backout[OPTION]\&... [\-r] REV

If you back out a changeset other than the tip, a new head is
created\&. This head will be the new tip and you should merge this
backout changeset with another head (current one by default)\&.

The \-\-merge option remembers the parent of the working directory

bisect[\-gbsr] [\-c CMD] [REV]
.RS 4
This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems\&. To use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem as good\&. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision for testing (unless the \-\-noupdate option is specified)\&. Once you have performed tests, mark the working directory as bad or good and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset or announce that it has found the bad revision\&.

As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first\&.

If you supply a command it will be used for automatic bisection\&. Its exit
status will be used as flag to mark revision as bad or good\&. In case exit

If no destination repository is specified the destination is
assumed to have all the nodes specified by one or more \-\-base

This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe\&.  The
operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during

Valid URLs are of the form:

local/filesystem/path (or file://local/filesystem/path)
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]
ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]

Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by \'hg bundle\' or
\'hg incoming \-\-bundle\')\&.

Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
\- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd\&.
\- path is relative to the remote user\'s home directory by default\&.
  Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
    ssh://example\&.com//tmp/repository
\- Mercurial doesn\'t use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
  to do is to configure it in your ~/\&.ssh/config, e\&.g\&.:
    Host *\&.mylocalnetwork\&.example\&.com
      Compression no
    Host *
      Compression yes
  Alternatively specify "ssh \-C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or
  with the \-\-ssh command line option\&.
.fi
.RE

These urls can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under the
[paths] section like so:
[paths]
alias1 = URL1
alias2 = URL2
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
You can then use the alias for any command that uses a url (for example
\'hg pull alias1\' would pull from the \'alias1\' path)\&.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults
when you do not provide the url to a command:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
default:
  When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
  the location of the source repository as the new repository\'s
  \'default\' path\&. This is then used when you omit path from push\-
  and pull\-like commands (including in and out)\&.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
default\-push:
  The push command will look for a path named \'default\-push\', and
  prefer it over \'default\' if both are defined\&.
